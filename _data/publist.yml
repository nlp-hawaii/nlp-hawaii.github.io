# - title: "Surveying Stylometry Techniques and Applications"
#   image: stylometry_survey.png
#   description: Here, we perform an extensive performance analysis on a corpus of 1,000 authors to investigate authorship attribution, verification, and clustering using 14 algorithms from the literature. Finally, several remaining research challenges are discussed, along with descriptions of various open-source and commercial software that may be useful for stylometry subtasks.

# - title: "Exploiting Linguistic Style as a Cognitive Biometric for Continuous Verification"
#   image: 
#   description: This paper presents an assessment of continuous verification using linguistic style as a cognitive biometric. In stylometry, it is widely known that linguistic style is highly characteristic of authorship using representations that capture authorial style at character, lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. In this work, we provide a contrast to previous efforts by implementing a one-class classification problem using Isolation Forests. Our approach demonstrates the usefulness of this classifier for accurately verifying the genuine user, and yields recognition accuracy exceeding 98% using very small training samples of 50 and 100-character blocks.

# - title: "Style Signatures to Combat Biometric Menagerie in Stylometry"
#   image: 
#   description: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of using a person's writing style as a cognitive biometric modality by applying Doddington's idea of Biometric menagerie. To the best of our knowledge, biometric menagerie analysis has been on performed on a cognitive biometric modality for the first time. The presence of goats, wolves and lambs in this modality is demonstrated using two publicly available datasets - Blogs and IMDB1M. To combat this challenging problem, we further propose using person-specific features referred to as "Style signatures" which may be better at distinguishing different individuals. Experimental results show that using person-specific Style signatures improve verification by 3.6-5.5% on both datasets.

# - title: "A Transition-based Parser for Unscoped Episodic Logical Forms"
#   image: ulf_transition_parser.png
#   description: This paper presents the first learned approach for parsing sentences into ULFs, using a growing set of annotated examples. Our method learns a sequence-to-sequence model for predicting the transition action sequence within a modified cache transition system and provides a strong baseline for future improvement. We also evaluate the efficacy of type grammar-based constraints, a word-to-symbol lexicon, and transition system state features in this task.

# - title: "Montague Induction Grammar"
#   image: montague_induction_grammar.png
#   description: Here, we propose a computational modeling framework for inducing combinatory categorial grammars from arbitrary language data. This framework provides fine-grained control over the assumptions that the induced grammar should conform to. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we deploy our framework for use in distributional analysis of the relationship between s(emantic)-selection and c(ategory)-selection, using as input a lexicon-scale acceptability judgment dataset focused on English verbs’ syntactic distribution and enforcing standard assumptions from the semantics literature on the induced grammar.
